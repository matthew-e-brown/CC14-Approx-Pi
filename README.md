# CC #14: Approximate Pi
Coding Challenge #14 from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com):

Coding Challenge is as follows:
> The area of a circle is defined as πr<sup>2</sup>. Estimate π to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.  
_Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup>._

I will be using a method very similar to what [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) used in [this YouTube video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cNnf_7e92Q)

I will use Python.
